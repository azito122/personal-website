@@text : I am Andrew Zito, a recent graduate of Hampshire College, where I studied web development and linguistics. Before that I went to Bard College at Simon's Rock, where I focused on philosophy. My technical background is in front and back end web development, along with some software engineering and general programming skills. My linguistics background includes courses in syntax, phonology, semantics, and computational linguistics. For more details please see my <a>resume</a>.

My eternal goal is to find ways to express my creativity through web development and programming, while also finding a way to use my linguistics expertise, if possible. I enjoy learning new programming languages and skills, chatting about why human language is so weird, and napping.
